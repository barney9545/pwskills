    "# 5. What is a function signature, and what information does it typically include?\n",
    "# A function signature in Python typically includes the function name, parameters (including their types and order), and return type. It serves as a unique identifier for the function, allowing other code to understand how to interact with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. Create a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their product.\n",
    "def product(a, b):\n",

    "#Function Parameters and Arguments:\n",
    "# 1. Explain the concepts of formal parameters and actual arguments in Python functions.\n",
    "# Formal parameters refer to the parameters defined in the function signature or definition. They act as placeholders for the values that will be passed into the function during function calls.\n",
    "# Actual arguments, on the other hand, are the values provided to the function when it is called. These values are assigned to the formal parameters defined in the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Write a Python program that defines a function with default argument values.\n",
    "def greet(name=\"World\"):\n",

    "\n",
    "greet()  # Output: Hello, World\n",
    "greet(\"Alice\")  # Output: Hello, Alice\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. How do you use keyword arguments in Python function calls? Provide an example.\n",
    "# Keyword arguments allow you to specify arguments by their parameter names when calling a function, which can improve code readability.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "def greet(name, greeting=\"Hello\"):\n",
    "    print(greeting + \", \" + name)\n",
    "\n",
    "greet(name=\"Alice\", greeting=\"Hi\")  # Output: Hi, Alice\n",

    "# 5. What is the purpose of the `*args` and `**kwargs` syntax in function parameter lists?\n",
    "# The `*args` syntax in function parameter lists allows a function to accept a variable number of positional arguments, while the `**kwargs` syntax allows it to accept a variable number of keyword arguments.\n",
    "# `*args` collects extra positional arguments into a tuple, and `**kwargs` collects extra keyword arguments into a dictionary. This flexibility enables functions to handle a wide range of inputs without explicitly defining every parameter.\n",

    "##Return Values and Scoping:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Describe the role of the `return` statement in Python functions and provide examples.\n",
    "# The `return` statement is used to exit a function and return a value to the caller. It can also be used to return multiple values as a tuple. If there is no `return` statement, the function returns `None` by default.\n",
    "# Example:\n",

    "# 5. How can you access variables defined outside a function from within the function?\n",
    "# You can access variables defined outside a function from within the function by using the `global` keyword to declare them as global variables, or by simply referencing them directly if they are in the global scope.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "global_var = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "def access_global():\n",

    "##Lambda Functions and Higher-Order Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. What are lambda functions in Python, and when are they typically used?\n",
    "# Lambda functions, also known as anonymous functions, are small, inline functions that are defined using the `lambda` keyword. They are typically used when a simple, one-line function is needed for a short period of time, often as an argument to higher-order functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Write a Python program that uses lambda functions to sort a list of tuples based on the second element.\n",
    "# Example:\n",

    "sorted_data = sorted(data, key=lambda x: x[1])\n",
    "print(sorted_data)  # Output: [(3, 2), (1, 5), (2, 8)]\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Explain the concept of higher-order functions in Python, and provide an example.\n",
    "# Higher-order functions are functions that can accept other functions as arguments or return functions as results. They enable functional programming paradigms in Python.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "def apply_function(func, lst):\n",
    "    return [func(x) for x in lst]\n",
    "\n",
    "result = apply_function(lambda x: x ** 2, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",

    "\n",
    "##Built-in Functions:\n",
    "# 1. Describe the role of built-in functions like `len()`, `max()`, and `min()` in Python.\n",
    "# - `len()`: Returns the number of items in an object, such as a list, tuple, string, etc.\n",
    "# - `max()`: Returns the largest item in an iterable or the largest of two or more arguments.\n",
    "# - `min()`: Returns the smallest item in an iterable or the smallest of two or more arguments.\n",
    "# These built-in functions provide convenient ways to perform common operations on data structures and values.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Write a Python program that uses the `map()` function to apply a function to each element of a list.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "squared_numbers = map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers)\n",
    "print(list(squared_numbers))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. How does the `filter()` function work in Python, and when would you use it?\n",
    "# The `filter()` function in Python filters elements of an iterable based on a function (predicate) that returns True or False. It returns an iterator containing the elements for which the function returns True.\n",
    "# You would use `filter()` when you need to selectively extract elements from an iterable based on a condition.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "even_numbers = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)\n",
    "print(list(even_numbers))  # Output: [2, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Create a Python program that uses the `reduce()` function to find the product of all elements in a list.\n",
    "# Note: Since Python 3, `reduce()` is no longer a built-in function and has been moved to the `functools` module.\n",
    "from functools import reduce\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "product = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, numbers)\n",
    "print(product)  # Output: 120\n",
    "\n",
    "##Function Documentation and Best Practices:\n",
    "# 1. Explain the purpose of docstrings in Python functions and how to write them.\n",
    "# Docstrings in Python functions serve as documentation for the function's purpose, usage, parameters, and return values. They provide a convenient way for developers to understand how to use the function without needing to inspect its source code. Docstrings are written as triple quotes (either single or double) immediately after the function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example of writing a docstring:\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Print a greeting message for the given name.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Args:\n",
    "        name (str): The name of the person to greet.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Returns:\n",
    "        None\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    print(\"Hello, \" + name)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Describe some best practices for naming functions and variables in Python, including naming conventions and guidelines.\n",
    "# - Use descriptive names: Choose names that clearly and accurately describe the purpose or content of the function or variable.\n",
    "# - Follow naming conventions: Adhere to PEP 8 guidelines for naming conventions, such as using lowercase letters with underscores for function and variable names (snake_case).\n",
    "# - Use meaningful prefixes or suffixes: Prefixes like `is_` or suffixes like `_list` can provide additional context to the name, making it clearer.\n",
    "# - Avoid single-letter names (except for iterators): Single-letter names are often ambiguous and should be avoided unless used for simple iterators like `i`, `j`, `k`.\n",
    "# - Be consistent: Maintain consistency in naming style throughout your codebase for readability and maintainability.\n",
    "# - Avoid reserved words: Avoid using reserved words or built-in function names as identifiers to prevent conflicts and confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# Good function names:\n",
    "def calculate_area(radius):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "def format_name(first_name, last_name):\n",
    "    pass\n",
